  In the past, the DOCTYPE was needed to specify HTML versions.
  As of HTML5, providing `html` is sufficient.
  It is somewhere between a proper HTML tag, and an HTML comment.

    A favicon is the small picture that shows up in the browser's
    tab. Historically, these used a proprietary ".ico" format, and
    you needed to provide many different sizes.
    Happily, you can now provide a single vector graphic in SVG
    format. It will scale to any size, and still look crisp.
